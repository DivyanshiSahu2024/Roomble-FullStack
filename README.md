Roomble
==================================

This full-stack web application is made as a course project : Software Development and Operations.

Roomble is an integrated property rental and flatmate matching application which seeks to solve the common problems faced by young newcomers to metro cities. Users are classified into 2 different categories - tenants and landlords. 

The platform simplifies the process of finding suitable rentals and appropriate flatmates with the following salient features -

### For Tenants:
* Search properties efficiently by location, price range, amenities, and more
* Find compatible flatmates using our smart recommendation algorithms and compatibility score
* Message landlords/flatmates directly within the platform
* Rate and review properties and flatmates after interactions

### For Landlords:
* List properties with detailed descriptions and photos
* Manage property availability and tenant inquiries
* Receive reviews from verified tenants

The interface of the web app is simple and intuitive ensuring that users will not face any difficulties while using the application and will have a seamless experience.
